The standard U.S. map shows states laid out in two dimensions, but doesn't
convey any information about the crucial third dimension: altitude.

So here are some maps to rectify that. There's nothing very surprising here,
except perhaps how clear of an East-West divide there is in maximum altitude.


#### Mean elevation

#### Minimum elevation
This map shows the Continental Divide most clearly.

#### Maximum elevation
Here, the Mississippi River basin stands out in the darker colors of the Midwest
states.

#### Elevation profiles
And last, everything on one chart. Lines show the elevation range, and dots are
the mean elevation.
